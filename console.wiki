= Interactive Repy Console =

This tool allows us to connect to our device through !WiFi and run Repy commands directly. At the moment, your computer and phone should be on the same !WiFi network. First, download our tool from [https://github.com/aaaaalbert/repy-doodles/blob/master/interactive_repy_console.r2py here].

Then in your seash console, load your keys and browse to your device (for example, %1). Then,

{{{
albert@%1 !> upload interactive_repy_console.r2py
albert@%1 !> [upload necessary library files]
albert@%1 !> start dylink.r2py interactive_repy_console.r2py
albert@%1 !> show log
Running program: dylink.r2py
Arguments: ['interactive_repy_console.r2py']

Listening on 192.168.37.130 port 63130
}}}

In a separate terminal window, do {{{nc}}}:

{{{
nc 192.168.37.130 63130
}}}

This opens a TCP connection to the IP/port the console listens on. Currently, we do not support telnet or ssh yet.

Now we can type commands. Note that only one-line statements are possible at the moment, but the results from each statement are stored in the same session and thus available for the next statements. For example:

{{{
for i in range(100): log(getruntime(), get_acceleration()); sleep(0.1)   

49.1445417786 [-0.068646550000000001, 1.6965504, 10.444082]
49.1524339104 [-0.0098066500000000001, 1.7259704, 10.699055]
49.1594899083 [-0.0098066500000000001, 1.7259704, 10.699055]
}}}

Note that sometimes if a command times out, we can exit the current {{{nc}}} session and restart interactive_repy_console in the seash console.
