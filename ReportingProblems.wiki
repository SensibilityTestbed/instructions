= Reporting Problems =

Are you running into any issues during install or use of Sensibility Testbed? The more we know about it, the sooner we'll have it fixed! There are a few ways of reporting issues, depending on how much detail you are willing to share.

The best place to go for feedback is our mailinglist, [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/sensibility-testbed sensibility-testbed@googlegroups.com]

 1. Just describe what happened, and what you did while it happened. E.g., 'In the Sensibility Testbed app, I chose About from the menu, but the app crashed instead of giving me additional information.'
 1. Share Sensibility Testbed's logfiles with us. They are located in {{{/sdcard/com.sensibilitytestbed}}} (*.py.log), {{{/sdcard/sl4a/seattle/seattle_repy/}}} (installInfo.*, installer*.log), and {{{/sdcard/sl4a/seattle/seattle_repy/v2}}} (nodemanager.*, softwareupdater.*). These files will include lots of details on the inner workings of Sensibility Testbed on your device, but no personally identifiable information.
 1. Share your log files as above, plus [http://developer.android.com/tools/help/logcat.html logcat] output. Note that this might include PII such as !WiFi networks your device is paired with, apps you have installed, etc. It's a good idea to filter such log output for {{{SensibilityTestbed}}} before you send it off to us.

Please include a description of your device (model and make, available storage, network interfaces, ...) in your report.
